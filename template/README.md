## Vue Bootstrap Webpack Started
Based on the webpack-simple template for vue-cli.

## Contribution Setup
Clone this repository and change to the directory of the template,
make your changes, add a feature, improve a styling, whatever. PR it then.
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Serve with hot reload
npm run dev
```
Make the changes you you want to make and pull request it.

## Usage
### Creating your project
For now clone the repository and perform the `constribution setup`.
Make sure you have `vue-cli` and `vue-init` installed.

```bash
$ npm install -g @vue/cli
$ npm install -g @vue/cli-init
```
In your terminal prompt, this will use the lates version of the template.

```bash
$ vue init ensibuuko/vue-bootstrap-template your-project-name
```
To use the development branch
```bash
$ vue init ensibuuko/vue-bootstrap-template#develop your-project-name
```

The style sass file has been customized to demonstrate how you can use it
to style your website colors according to your needs.
All customizations goes into 'styles/custom.scss file.'
